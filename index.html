                <h3>About Me!</h3>
                <P> After obtaining my masters degree, in school counseling from Brooklyn College , I worked as a college advisor and personal chef. Although I enjoyed both fields, I discovered my passion for software engineering thanks to the shopify website I helped my wife build. 
                    
                Thanks to Thinkfuls part-time flex program I was able to develop the skill set necessary to transition into a career as a software engineer.
